# Neural Network Framework in C++ with GPU Acceleration

## Overview

This project is a neural network framework implemented from scratch in C++ with a focus on object-oriented programming and GPU acceleration. It includes custom implementations of key components of neural networks, such as dense layers, activation functions (Sigmoid and ReLU), loss functions (Mean Squared Error), and optimization algorithms (SGD, RMSprop, and Adam).

The code is designed to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of neural networks and GPU programming. It showcases various aspects, including:

- Creating neural network layers using object-oriented programming principles.
- Implementing activation functions (Sigmoid and ReLU) for non-linear transformations.
- Defining loss functions (Mean Squared Error) to measure the network's performance.
- Incorporating optimization algorithms (SGD, RMSprop, and Adam) for efficient training.
- Leveraging GPU acceleration for matrix computations (CUDA-based).

## Usage

To use this neural network framework, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler with CUDA support.
3. Modify and extend the code to build your custom neural network architecture or experiment with different configurations.
4. Use GPU acceleration for matrix computations (requires a compatible NVIDIA GPU and CUDA toolkit).

## Sample Code

// Include necessary headers and set up your network architecture
// ...

int main() {
    // Initialize the neural network layers, loss function, and optimizer
    // ...

    // Load your dataset and prepare it for training
    // ...

    // Train the network using forward and backward passes
    // ...

    // Monitor the training progress and evaluate the model
    // ...

    // Save the trained model for future use
    // ...

    return 0;
}
